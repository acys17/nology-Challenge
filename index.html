      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <div id="about-me">
        <div class="am-icon"><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i></div>
        <div class="am-icon"><i class="far fa-newspaper"></i></div>
        <div class="am-icon"><i class="fas fa-id-card-alt"></i></div>
        <div>I am a BSc <em>(Hons)</em> Zoology graduate from the University of Manchester. 
          Having loved maths and logical thinking from an early age, here I developed my research 
          and analytical skills culminating in a metanalysis of levels of aggression in primates 
          using R software to perform my analyses.</div>
        <div>I previously edited and published research papers for the online scientific 
          journal <em>ScientificReports</em> at SpringerNature Publishing House Ltd. I was responsible 
          for ensuring that publication targets were met in a fast-paced yet high-quality manner. Here 
          I realised I have an affinity for technology and picking up new skills and learning how to use
        new software.</div>
        <div>I am an ex-Police Officer for the Metropolitan Police Service, working in front-line 
          policing in Westminster. Here I developed my interpersonal skills and became 
          well practised in handling high-pressure situations through conducting investigations and 
          interviews, managing crime scenes policing protests and enforcing lockdown 
          restrictions to name a few</div>

    <h2>Things I Love</h2><br>
    <div id="my-interests">
      <div class="mi-icon"><i class="fas fa-plane"></i> Travel - I love to visit new places and try new 
        things. My next adventure goal is to visit South America - Machu Pichu in particular, but my list 
        of places to go is endless.</div>
      <div class="mi-icon"><i class="fas fa-paw"></i> DOGS - I have a (borderline unhealthy) obssession
      with dogs. So much so that I will drop everything I am doing, or forget everything I am saying
       whenever I see one.</div>
      <div class="mi-icon"><i class="fas fa-tools"></i> DIY/Craft - I love a good challenge and being 
        creative. My social media and photo albums pages are always filled with numerous DIY videos and tutorials.</div>
      <div class="mi-icon"><i class="fas fa-walking"></i> Fitness - I love swimming and walking. My 
        highest step count so far is 72,000 steps in a day! I also have a 100km walk planned for the future
        during which I intend to double that! </div>
      <div class="mi-icon"><i class="fas fa-utensils"></i> Cooking - Whatever space is left in my phone photo
      album and instagram feed (after the DIY videos and dogs pictures) is filled with food. I should probably say I'm more
     interested in food than cooking, but when I have the time I do love to cook and try to recreate
     the food I've been staring at all day (with mixed results).</div>
      <div class="mi-icon"><i class="far fa-keyboard"></i> Web Development - Something I've really missed 
      since university is being interlectually challenged. Being relatively new to web design and writing 
      code, so far it has been a steep learning curve which I know will only get steeper and more challenging.
      I am excited to keep learning and improving to be able to create content I am proud of.</div>

        <div class="fg-icon"><i class="far fa-smile"></i></i></div>
        <div>I am currently enrolled in a _nology bootcamp course where I will develop my coding 
          skills and take my first notable steps towards a new and exciting career in tech</div>
        <div>As the programming industry is ever evolving and advancing, I will continue to grow 
          and progress also, learning new languages and skills to produce the best results possible.</div>
        <div>Ultimately I hope to find a job I love, and one that gives me great job satisfaction with 
          numerous learning opportunities and different avenues to explore </div>
